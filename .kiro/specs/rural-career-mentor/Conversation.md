Create Spec: Build an AI-powered voice-first career mentorship platform for rural youth in India.  The system should help students after 10th/12th who lack career guidance, English proficiency, resume preparation, interview skills, and awareness of local job opportunities.  Key capabilities required:  - Multilingual voice interaction in regional Indian languages - AI-based career path recommendation using user interests, education, and location - Skill learning guidance through free courses and government programs - Automatic resume generation in English and local language - AI mock interview with speech analysis and improvement feedback - Matching users with nearby jobs, apprenticeships, and gig opportunities - Low-bandwidth and affordable smartphone compatibility - Scalable cloud-based architecture for nationwide deployment  The goal is to guide rural youth from career confusion to employment.

**Assistant:**

This is an ambitious and impactful project! Let me help you create a comprehensive spec for this AI-powered voice-first career mentorship platform for rural youth in India.

I'll start by creating a detailed specification that captures all the requirements and guides the implementation.

I'll help you create a comprehensive spec for this AI-powered voice-first career mentorship platform. Let me start by creating the requirements document following the Requirements-First workflow.

Now let me ask for your review of the requirements document:

Great! Now I'll move on to creating the design document. Let me start by writing the initial sections, then I'll use the prework tool before writing the Correctness Properties section.

**User:**

why was design.md creation canceled

---

**Assistant:**

Let me check the design.md file to see what happened:

I can see the design.md file exists and has content. It looks like the design document creation was started but may have been interrupted. The file contains the beginning of a comprehensive design document for the Rural Career Mentor Platform, including:

- Overview section
- Architecture section with a Mermaid diagram (partially visible)

The file appears to be incomplete - it cuts off mid-diagram in the Data Layer section. This suggests the creation process was canceled or interrupted before completion.

Would you like me to complete the design document, or would you prefer to start fresh? I can also help you understand what might have caused the interruption if you'd like to share more context about what happened during the creation process.

**User:**

Complete the design document

---

**Assistant:**

Now I'll complete the design document based on the requirements:

Design document completed. The document now includes comprehensive architecture details, technology stack, data models, API design, voice interaction flows, security measures, scalability design, and eight correctness properties for property-based testing.

Refine these documents for AWS AI for Bharat hackathon impact and scalability.

---

**Assistant:**

I'll refine the documents to emphasize AWS services, hackathon impact metrics, and demonstrate scalability for the AWS AI for Bharat hackathon. Let me update both the requirements and design documents.

Now let me refine the design document to focus on AWS services and hackathon impact:

Now let me add a hackathon-specific section and update the deployment section:

Now let me add a hackathon impact section before the testing strategy:

Now let me update the Future Enhancements section to be more hackathon-focused:

Now let me add a brief AWS-focused introduction to the requirements document:

Perfect! Now let me add a closing note to the requirements document emphasizing AWS and hackathon goals:

Excellent! I've refined both documents for the AWS AI for Bharat hackathon. Here's what I've updated:

**Design Document Enhancements:**
- Replaced generic cloud architecture with AWS-specific services (Transcribe, Polly, Bedrock, Personalize, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)
- Added detailed AWS service justifications and architecture diagrams
- Included AWS CDK infrastructure code examples
- Added comprehensive cost analysis ($0.018/user/month)
- Created a hackathon impact section with scalability proof points (1K → 10M users)
- Demonstrated AWS services working together in real workflows
- Added measurable impact metrics (10M users, 500K job placements in 12 months)
- Included competitive advantages and sustainability model

**Requirements Document Enhancements:**
- Added AWS AI innovation section highlighting key services
- Included problem statement with statistics (65% rural population, 200M+ youth)
- Added solution impact metrics (99% cost reduction, 24/7 availability)
- Created AWS service mapping table linking each requirement to specific AWS services
- Added hackathon success criteria covering technical excellence, innovation, social impact, and business viability

Both documents now clearly demonstrate how AWS services enable unprecedented scale, affordability, and impact for rural career mentorship in India.
